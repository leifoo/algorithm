    "For example, inserting into a list is easy (happens in constant time). However, inserting into an array is O(n), since you may need to shift elements to make space for the one you're inserting, or even copy everything to a new array if you run out of space. Thus, inserting into a Python list is actually O(n), while operations that search for an element at a particular spot are O(1).

    "\n",
    "#### Weakly Connected\n",
    "A directed graph is weakly connected when only replacing all of the directed edges with undirected edges can cause it to be connected. Imagine that your graph has several vertices with one outbound edge, meaning an edge that points from it to some other vertex in the graph. There's no way to reach all of those vertices from any other vertex in the graph, but if those edges were changed to be undirected all vertices would be easily accessible.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If you're storing a disconnected graph, not every node will be tied to an edge, so you should store a list of nodes.\n",

    "## <a>8. Technical Interviewing Techniques</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.1 Interview Introduction</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When an interviewer asks you a question, your ability to get the right answer is a small part of what they're evaluating. They also want to see your approach to solving problems and your communication skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seven steps:\n",
    "1. Clarifying the Question\n",
    "2. Generating Inputs & Outputs\n",
    "3. Generating Test Cases.\n",
    "4. Brainstorming\n",
    "5. Runtime Analysis\n",
    "6. Coding\n",
    "7. Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.2 Clarifying the Question</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Clarifying a problem is crucial to being a good software developer. You need to prove to your interviewer that you won't dive head first into a problem and potentially waste time writing code that doesn't solve the initial issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.3 Confirming Inputs</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Confirming the signature of the algorithm. What's given and what the result needs to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.4 Test Cases</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thinking through tests and edge cases for inputs. Think all the possible weird inputs that have to handle. It's always a good idea to think about how your code handles null and empty inputs, since not addressing them could cause your code to crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.5 Brainstorming</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use test cases to inch the way towards developing a solution. Good communication with the interviewers. Take the interviewers' cues to guide him towards the correct solution. The interviewer is there to help you. And being able to take in their feedback demonstrates your teamwork skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the interviewee is still stuck after looking at the test cases and edge cases. What kind of data structure to represent the problem and what algorithm are commonly used to solve this type of data structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.6 Runtime Analysis</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the steps of the algorithm and calculate the Big O runtime. This is an important step because you may realize that your solution is not optimal while analyzing runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.7 Coding</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the interviewer know what you are doing when you are coding. Don't read out all the codes as you are coding, which is annoying. Focus on explaining the purpose of the code while writing. By talking out loud, you give your  interviewer the chance to jump in and help if your logic is wrong. You also prove the interviewer that you're actually thinking through all of your code. If you just write code you might be spitting out a memorized answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a>8.8 Debugging</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Look through the code.\n",
    "2 Run edge cases.\n",
    "3 Run through the test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugging process is often overlooked but a very important part of the algorithm interview. Not only does this show the interviewer that you check your code, it may even help the candidate find mistakes that you miss the first time you were coding your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a> Interview Wrap-Up</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The more practice you have the better chance you'll perform better. Make sure to approach your interviews with a positive mindset, and don't give up.\n",
